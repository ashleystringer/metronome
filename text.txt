- Updating feature requirements: 
    - Allow the user to update a bar sequence by selecting the metronome buttons
    - There needs to be a way to change the mode to an update mode [X].
    - There needs to be a way to make the Time Signature component alter the given bar sequence. 
    - There needs to be a way for the UpdateCardModal to indicate which bar sequence should be updated.
    - There needs to be reorganization of the bar sequences. 
    - There needs to be storage established for the bar sequences.


*** Make sure to set the ID of the bar sequence that's going to be subject to an update in the BarSequenceProvider.
    *** (based on which Card is selected and update mode being on)
*** Update that new state within TimeSignatureSelector and BPMRange
    *** using the ID for that bar sequence to update the state in customBarSequence.
*** Finalize the update using updateBarPattern in BarSequenceProvider. 
    *** If there's found to be a difference in the state in customBarSequence and barGroup, update barGroup.
*** Reset the sequence ID state after the update is finalized and update node is turned off.
